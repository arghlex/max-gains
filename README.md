A gym app for saving workout history.

Initially created for a final project on the Mobile Web Apps W3Dev Campus course in 2012. First experience with utilising local storage in the browser. Also used HTML5 Boilerplate for setup.

The plan is to build on this initial idea and bring up to date with current technology.
